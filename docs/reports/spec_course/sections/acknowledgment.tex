\section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression, ``One of us (R. B. G.) thanks . . .''  Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks''. Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
